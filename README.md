Thesis dissertation about the application of clustering and portfolio optimization models to cryptocurrency market 

Innovation an essential element in the financial industry, an industry where any competitive
advantage translates very directly into a diferential performance over the rest of the
competitors. The continuous search for the alpha that grants that advantage is the objective
that catalyses the application of very diferent technologies in the financial environment from
very varied scientisc fields such as computation, mathematics, statistics or a combination of
all of them such as Artificial Intelligence. This innovation is what has led both institutional
and private investors to focus their attention on the crypto-asset markets as a further possibility
to incorporate into their investment portfolios. This surprising development of the
cryptocurrency market, from being a peripheral market to being capitalised at the level of a
medium-sized stock exchange with sustained growth, provides us with a unique opportunity
to observe its evolution.
The leap from a traditional financial market to the crypto-asset market is not trivial
given its particular statistical complexity, which diferentiates it in many respects from
other markets. The temptation is to replicate the same investment models and techniques
from one market to the other in the belief that a cryptocurrency listed on a trading platform
or exchange must behave in a similar way to a share in any other market. This way of acting
can lead to heavy losses during a hard learning process.

The research shown here aims to guide investors in this new market by providing them
with tools to help them manage their investments, ensuring their scalability and adaptability
to a changing market. The scope of the research carried out is developed in the space where
digital trading markets, Blockchain, Machine Learning combined with traditional portfolio
optimisation techniques converge, all within what is popularly known as "FinTech".
The contribution of the work presented here is twofold: on the one hand, we propose a
methodology based on partitional clustering that helps to detect and describe the underlying
structures in the cryptoasset market by combining diferent clustering algorithms; and on the
other hand, using these same clustering techniques, we show how to use them in a filtering
stage that improves the performance of the classic portfolio optimisation algorithm, Mean-
Variance.

The application of clustering in the detection of groupings in Fnancial markets is not
new, but it is, and this is one of the contributions of the research presented here, the fact of
being able to combine diferent forms of representation of assets and apply diferent clustering
techniques to them, combining the results obtained and ofering a more complete vision of the
market. In this way, investors will have more information when determining their investment
strategy by pre-selecting those assets that at a first step may seem more interesting. In this
phase of the research we have found significant associations between diferent financial ratios
and clusters, as well as between technological attributes of cryptocurrencies and market
characteristics such as market cap and trading volume. Similarly, we can present as an
important innovation in this first phase of the research, one of the first applications of 
histogram clustering techniques to financial markets, and in any case the first application
to cryptocurrency markets.

Every investment process involves a decision phase in which the investor decides in
which assets and with what percentage of his funds taking a position on the stocks. This
area of financial decision making has been developed since the 1950's mainly through the
development of a broad portfolio management theory strongly supported by mathematical
optimisation tools and a profound development of the investor's preference theory. The use of
clustering as a phase of improvement in the performance of an investment portfolio is based
on a use case of the methodology proposed in the first contribution and constitutes a novel
contribution that allows the adaptation of existing portfolio models to the cryptocurrency
market. In this second contribution, clustering is understood as a fundamental filtering tool
for the cryptoasset market itself, given the enormous diversity of cryptocurrencies and their
unequal behaviour.

Another important factor that is analysed is the persistence of the results and structures
in the face of variations in the time window, and in this case we have seen that those
clustering techniques that take as a measure of dissimilarity the diference in the shape of
the series are less persistent and although the result is not conclusive, it does give clues as
to which clustering techniques would be most appropriate based on the objectives that we
set ourselves. In other words, we can confirm that the persistence of the results of diferent
clustering techniques difers when faced with changes in the time window.
In general, attempts to transfer various methods of analysis and optimisation from traditional
financial markets to cryptocurrency markets have only just begun, and the work of
this research shows a path in the application of partitional clustering in the first term market
description and in the improvement of portfolio optimisation algorithms in the second term.
